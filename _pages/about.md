I’m a 4th-year PhD candidate at Harvard University, aiming to make our online experiences better! My research is around social media and mental health, digital well-being design, online health communication, and media exposures to eating disorders risk factors. I combine online traces, text, screenshots, with survey data in experimental and longitudinal study designs. 

## My research
I am working on my PhD dissertation, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Amit Goldenberg](https://www.amitgoldenberg.com/), [Prof. Vish Viswanath](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/kasisomayajula-viswanath/), [Prof. David Canning](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/david-canning/), and [Dr. Laura Marciano](https://www.laura-marciano.com/). 
Beyond that, I’m deeply involved in exciting projects with the [Harvard Center for Health Communication](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/chc/), the [Harvard Center for Health and Happiness](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/health-happiness/), [STRIPED](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/), and [Harvard Berkman Klein Center](https://cyber.harvard.edu/).

## Past experience
In the past, I worked as a research scientiest intern at the Demographic and Survey Science team at Meta, and as a data scientist at JPMorgan Chase Institute. 
Prior to that, I earned my master’s in Global Health and Population at Harvard Chan School, following by my 5-year undergraduate medical training at Peking University Health Science Center.
I was engaged in fieldworks in rural China and rural South Africa, experiences that highlighted the stark disparities and gaps in global human development.


## Beyond work
I am a big fan of rock climbing, kickboxing, snowboarding, hiking, Chinese Neolithic archaeology, documentary filmmaking, reading and making maps, food, cooking, and cats.
